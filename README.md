## Setup Instructions

1. **Edit the Bird List**

2. **Run the App**

   Double-click `quiz_from_csv.exe` to launch the program.

3. **If You Update the List**

   After editing `birds.csv`, be sure to **delete** the generated file `bird_taxon_list.csv` before running the app again. This ensures that the taxon codes are updated correctly.
